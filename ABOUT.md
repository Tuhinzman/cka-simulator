### Journey to Cloud Engineering

My path wasn't traditional. I moved to the USA in 2012 from Bangladesh, completed my Computer Science degree at Bronx Community College, and overcame significant challenges including my father's passing in 2016. After working as a taxi driver, bar back, and in restaurants while pursuing my engineering dreams, I transitioned into DevOps engineering through persistence and continuous learning.

### Why I Built This CKA Simulator

This project combines real exam scenarios with production-ready infrastructure, making CKA preparation accessible and cost-effective (under $5/day). It's my contribution to the community that helped me learn.
